# Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of the algorithms presented in the book "Algorithms" by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, and Clifford Stein. The purpose of this repository is to store and organize the solutions to the problems and algorithms discussed in the book, with the goal of facilitating the learning and application of these concepts.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

`git clone https://github.com/bispodevacct/algorithms.git`

2. Navigate to the repository directory:

`cd algorithms`

3. Explore the files within each chapter directory and view the algorithm implementations.
4. Run the codes as needed. Most algorithms can be executed directly, but some may require additional dependencies, which will be mentioned at the beginning of each code.
